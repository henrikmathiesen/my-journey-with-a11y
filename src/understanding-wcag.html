                <h2>Understanding WCAG</h2>
                <p>
                    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines was first released 1998. Version 2 was released 2008 and version 2.1 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of WCAG is to make content more accessible for people with disabilities. 
                    But allthough web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities it is useful for all people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WCAG is authored in such a way that compliance with it can be tested by a combination of machine and human evaluation.
                    There are other accessibility measures like "short paragraphs", these techniques promotes usability for all users,
                    but are not included in WCAG because they are not easely testable.
                </p>
                <h3 class="h4">The Four Principles</h3>
                <p>
                    The foundation for WCAG are four principles (POUR): Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.
                </p>
