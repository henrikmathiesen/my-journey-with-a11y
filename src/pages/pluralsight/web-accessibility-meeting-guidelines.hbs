            <p>
                Section 508 vs WCAG 2.1. Which guideline to choose?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Semantic HTML</li>
                <li>Lists and navigation</li>
                <li>Accessible tables</li>
                <li>Accessible forms</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Some screen reader testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility is not a checklist. Meeting guidelines is dependent on each use case.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course is 100% applicable to WCAG 1.0 through WCAG 2.1.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h4">Choosing a Web Conformance Guideline</h3>
            <p>
                Section 508 VS Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guidelines provide help for us to make user interfaces accessible to people with disabilities.
                They also protect against lawsuits (it does happen), but we should rather focus on the possitive,
                in essence make accessible interfaces for all users and better SEO. Following guidelines also
                future proof our site and alo future proof ourselves (because old age can impact vision and mobility).
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5">Section 508 (USA)</h4>
            <p>
                1986 amendment to Rehabilitation Act of 1973, updated in 2017.
                Targeting websites developed or used by federal agencies, or funded by a federal agency.

            </p>

            <h4 class="h5">WCAG 2.1 (W3C)</h4>
            <p>
                WCAG 2.1 was released in 2018 by the WCAG Working Group (WCAG WG), 
                which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).
                It is meant to be a globaly accepted standard of accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                WCAG 2.1 has <strong>78 criteria</strong> organized under <strong>13 guidelines</strong>
                under <strong>4 principles</strong>. 
                These principles are: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust (POUR).
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Perceivable</h5>
            <p>
                Users must be able to perceive the information being presented, the content must be available to everyone.
                Blind users should be able to perceive what information images convey. Videos should have captions so hearing impaired
                users can perceive them.
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Operable</h5>
            <p>
                Users must be able to operate the interface: mouse, keyboard, touch or other method. A physical dissibility should not get in the way. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Understandable</h5>
            <p>
                Users must be able to understand the information and the user interface.
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Robust</h5>
            <p>
                Users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (there are many browsers, devices, screen readers).
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Level of Conformance</h5>
            <p>
                Each criteria is labeled a level of conformance, ranging from A to AA to AAA.
                Level AAA contains Level AA that contains Level A.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Level A: Most basic of web accessibility features</li>
                <li>Level AA: Biggest and most common barries</li>
                <li>Level AAA: Highest level of accessibility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">WCAG 2 Overview | Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) | W3C</a>
            </p>
            <h3 class="h4">Section 508 VS WCAG</h3>
            <p>
                You should choose WCAG 2.1 AA (achieving AAA is very difficult and sometime not realistic)
            </p>
            <p>
                Section 508 is only scoped to the USA and limited to federal agencies.
                WCAG has global acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA covers all of Section 508.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rest of the course will focus on WCAG 2.1 AA.
            </p>

            <h3 class="h4">HTML</h3>
            <p>
                One big secret to great accessibility lies in the markup, the type of HTML we choose to build our site.
                It kind of makes it easy because "it is just HTML", but it makes it hard because we actually need to know how to use HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML = Semantic = very important to accessibility. We get so much accessibility for free if we use HTML properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building a site with div and span tags, styling it with CSS and create interactivity with JavaScript "will work" --
                but it is definitely not accessible. You could kind of make it accessible by using aria, but that would be a long
                and hard round trip to fix everything you stripped out.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Semantic HTML is accessible and has been since the beginning of the web.</strong>
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5">Document Structure and Landmarks</h4>
            <h5 class="h6">Head tag</h5>
            <p>
                Make sure there is a valid doctype (WCAG 4.1.1), and HTML is valid, with no duplicate IDs.
                Also use the lang attribute (WCAG 3.1.1) on the HTML tag.
                Each page should have a good title (WCAG 2.4.2) unique for every page.
                Set the viewport meta (WCAG 1.4.4), allow users to pinch and zoom. Also use relative units (REM/EM/PERCENT) (WCAG 1.4.4).
                Use a good responsive design.
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Body tag - landmarks</h5>
            <p>
                Focusing on the content in the body tag, we should section our content with landmarks (HTML 5), (WCAG 1.3.1).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Header</li>
                <li>Nav (if several, use an aria-label)</li>
                <li>Main (can only be used once on a page)</li>
                <li>Footer</li>
                <li>Aside (teacher puts this as a sibbling to main)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Users with assistive technologies can discover these elements.
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Body tag - headers</h5>
            <p>
                Think of headers as the table of content for the page (WCAG 1.3.1).
                H1 tag is required and should appear only once, and the rest of headers should be in an logical order and describing the content of their section (WCAG 2.4.6).
                Preferebly the H1 should be the first element in the main section. Also think about H1 matching the title of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Screen reader users will often use the headers to navigate the page, so it is important that they are in a logical order.
                H1, H2, H3 etc. (We can style them with CSS).
            </p>

            <h4 class="h5">Lists</h4>
            <p>
                You are not required to use lists, but they can be really usefull and used for a lot of things. They are relevant to (WCAG 1.3.1).
            </p>
            <p>
                If a list is ordered, use the ol tag. Use ul tag for generic list with no order. Description list is used with dl tag (name and value pairs (glossary or FAQ for example)).
            </p>
            <h5 class="h6">Why bother with lists?</h5>
            <p>
                Better semantic. A screen reader user can discover the lists, gets information about the type of list and how many items it contains.
            </p>

            <h4 class="h5">Navigation and Skip Links</h4>
            <p>
                Consistent navigation, multiple ways to find a page, meaningful links, consistent overall interface, skip links.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use ul or ol tags in the nav element (WCAG 1.3.1).
            </p>
            <p>
                Dont use images of text, use proper text (WCAG 1.4.5) also (WCAG 1.4.4)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>(WCAG 3.2.3) says that navigation should be consistent (in the same place on every page and in the same order).</li>
                <li class="mt-2">(WCAG 2.4.5) says that there should be multiple ways to find a page (link, sitemap, search functionality (role=search, type=search)).</li>
                <li class="mt-2">(WCAG 3.2.4) says that components with the same functionality should be identified consistently (dont switch things up).</li>
                <li class="mt-2">(WCAG 2.4.4) says that links purpose can be determined from the link text alone or together with its programmatically context (for example aria-labelledby)</li>
                <li class="mt-2">(WCAG 2.4.1) bypass blocks, used to skip to main content, bypassing content that are repeated on multiple pages (for example a manu). Use proper semantics and landmarks. Skip links are extra nice for keyboard users not using assistive technology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h5">Tables</h4>
            <p>
                (WCAG 1.3.1) is important with tables. Dont use tables for layout (we are past that now, heh).
                Again, assistive technologies uses the semantics of a table to better present the content to the user.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Might use a caption (use instead of a header or an intro), but not required</li>
                <li>thead, tfoot, tbody: used for structure (optional in simple cases)</li>
                <li>tr, th, td</li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#attr-scope">scope</a> or
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#attr-headers">headers</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Screen readers can have problems with complex tables (multiple headers with the headers attribute)...
            </p>
