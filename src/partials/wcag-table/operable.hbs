    <td>
        The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content does not "trap" keyboard focus.
        If a user can move to a part of the page via the keyboard, the user must also be able to move away from it using only the keyboard.
        This is often an issue on pages that rely on plugins, such as Flash or Java applets, make sure the plugin can return keyboard focus.

        If the site/app has single key shortcuts, let users turn them off or remap them.
        Note that this success criterion doesn't affect components such as listboxes and drop-down menus, that may be selected by one or more character keys, the shortcuts are only active when the components have focus.
        Accesskeys are also not affected because they include modifier keys.

    <td>A</td>
    <td>
        The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users with disabilities are given adequate time to interact with Web content whenever possible.
        Any process that happens without user initiation after a set time or on a periodic basis is a time limit. This includes partial or full updates of content (for example, page refresh), 
        changes to content, or the expiration of a window of opportunity for a user to react to a request for input.
        Also animated, moving or scrolling content introduces a time limit on a users ability to read content.

    <td>
        User should be able to: turn off, adjust the length (10x default setting), request more time (20 seconds to do so, at least 10 times).
        Disabling time limits is better than customizing the length of time limits, which is better than requesting more time before a time limit occurs.
        There are exceptions, for example real time events like an auction. 20 hours+ time limit is also an exception.

        The intent of this Success Criterion is to avoid distracting users during their interaction with a Web page.
        Partial content that moves, blinks, flashes, scrolls or auto updates, like animations, weather information or stock tickers
        can be distracting for people with certain disabilties.

    </td>
    <td>
        Users should be able to pause, stop or hide partial content that is auto updating or moving, blinking or scrolling that lasts more than 5 seconds.
        An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered an excempt if interaction cannot occur during that phase.
        Having an animation stop only so long as a user has focus on it (where it restarts as soon as the user moves the focus away) would not be considered a 
        "mechanism for the user to pause" because it makes the page unusable in the process and would not meet this SC.

        This Success Criterion works in tandem with Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable, but is specifically focused on notification of timeouts related to user inactivity.
