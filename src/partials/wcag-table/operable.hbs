        The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content does not "trap" keyboard focus.
        If a user can move to a part of the page via the keyboard, the user must also be able to move away from it using only the keyboard.
        This is often an issue on pages that rely on plugins, such as Flash or Java applets, make sure the plugin can return keyboard focus.
