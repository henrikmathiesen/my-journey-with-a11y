        Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately 
        when the language of the Web page is identified. Screen readers can load the correct pronunciation rules. 
        Visual browsers can display characters and scripts (the writing system) correctly. Media players can show captions correctly. 
        As a result, users with disabilities will be better able to understand the content.

        Any component that is able to trigger an event when it receives focus must not change the context.
        For example: When a field receives focus, a help dialog window describing the field and providing options opens. 
        As a keyboard user tabs through the Web page, the dialog opens, moving the keyboard focus away from the control 
        every time the user attempts to tab past the field.
