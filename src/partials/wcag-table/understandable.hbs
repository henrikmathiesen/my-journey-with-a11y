        Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately 
        when the language of the Web page is identified. Screen readers can load the correct pronunciation rules. 
        Visual browsers can display characters and scripts (the writing system) correctly. Media players can show captions correctly. 
        As a result, users with disabilities will be better able to understand the content.

        The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present content written in multiple languages.
        This is especially important when switching between languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left, 
        or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet.
        If there is doubt whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced the 
        same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding text.

        The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people who are blind, people who have low vision, and people with reading disabilities to understand content in cases where meaning depends on pronunciation.
        For example, in the English language heteronyms are words that are spelled the same but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as the words desert (abandon) and desert (arid region). 
        If the proper pronunciation can be determined from the context of the sentence, then nothing is required. If it cannot then some mechanism for determining the proper pronunciation would be required.

        Any component that is able to trigger an event when it receives focus must not change the context.
        For example: When a field receives focus, a help dialog window describing the field and providing options opens. 
        As a keyboard user tabs through the Web page, the dialog opens, moving the keyboard focus away from the control 
        every time the user attempts to tab past the field.

        Change of content != change of context. <br>
        Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context. <br>
        Tooltip that does not recieve focus is ok (but use a button with click event instead).<br>
