        Ensure that user agents, including assistive technologies, can accurately interpret and parse content. 
        If the content cannot be parsed into a data structure, then different user agents may present it differently 
        or be completely unable to parse it. Some user agents use "repair techniques" to render poorly coded content.
        Since repair techniques vary among user agents, authors cannot assume that content will be accurately parsed into a data structure.

        The intent of this Success Criterion is to make users aware of important changes in content that are not given focus, and to do so in a way that doesn't unnecessarily interrupt their work.
        The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve status messages.
        <br><br>
        This Success Criterion specifically addresses scenarios where new content is added to the page without changing the user's context. 
        Changes of context, by their nature, interrupt the user by taking focus. They are already surfaced by assistive technologies, 
        and so have already met the goal to alert the user to new content.
        <br><br>
        Information can be added to pages which does not meet the definition of a status message. For example, the list of results obtained from a search are not considered a status update and 
        thus are not covered by this Success Criterion. However, brief text messages displayed about the completion or status of the search, such as "Searching...", "18 results returned" or 
        "No results returned" would be status updates if they do not take focus.

        Make sure assistive technologies can recieve status messages that are not focusable (change of content).<br>
        Also communicate when status messages are hidden. <br>
        Use role=status. <br>
        Use aria-live=assertive or role=alert for error/warning messages.<br>
        role=alert is equivalent to using aria-live=assertive.<br>
        There is also aria-live=polite <br>
