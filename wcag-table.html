                            This allows a more fine-grained definition or identification of purpose than the type attribute.

                            The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to turn off updates from the author/server except in emergencies 
                            (civil emergency alert messages or any other messages that warn of danger to health, safety, or property, including data loss, loss of connection, etcetera).
                            This allows people with disabilities to focus on the content.

                            For security reasons, many sites implement an authentication time limit after a certain period of inactivity. 
                            These time limits may cause problems for persons with disabilities because it may take longer for them to complete the activity.

                            This Success Criterion works in tandem with Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable, but is specifically focused on notification of timeouts related to user inactivity.
                            The use of timeouts can present barriers for users with disabilities, as these users may require more time to read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online form.
                            This Success Criterion helps users by ensuring they are notified about timeouts related to inactivity.
