                            The HTML autocomplete attribute takes this one step further, only accepting a certain number of specific well-defined fixed values.
                            This allows a more fine-grained definition or identification of purpose than the type attribute.

                            Some users can experience seizures due to photosensitivity if content flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes.
                            People are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors.
                            Blinking can be allowed for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped).
                            Blinking usually does not occur at speeds of 3 per second or more, but it can. If blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.

                            The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide headings for sections of a Web page, when the page is organized into sections.
                            Section tag can stand on its own but can also be part (like a chapter) of an Article element (see HTML sectioning flowchart under resources).
                            When such sections exist, they need to have headings that introduce them.
                            This provision is included at Level AAA because it cannot be applied to all types of content and it may not always be possible to insert headings, 
                            for example, when posting a pre-existing document to the Web.

                            For example, a text field has a [label] that says First name and an [aria-label] that says Your name, 
                            in this case, a screen reader would be presented with "Your Name" when they navigate into the field, and nothing will happen if a Dragon user says "Click First Name."

                            Ensure that user agents, including assistive technologies, can accurately interpret and parse content. 
                            If the content cannot be parsed into a data structure, then different user agents may present it differently 
                            or be completely unable to parse it. Some user agents use "repair techniques" to render poorly coded content.
                            Since repair techniques vary among user agents, authors cannot assume that content will be accurately parsed into a data structure.

                            The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that Assistive Technologies (AT) can gather information about, activate(or set) and keep up to date on the status of user interface controls in the content.
                            A particularly important state of a user interface control is whether or not it has focus. The focus state of a control can be programmatically determined, and notifications about change of focus are sent 
                            to user agents and assistive technology. Other examples of user interface control state are whether or not a checkbox or radio button has been selected, or whether or not a collapsible tree or list node is expanded or collapsed.

                            The intent of this Success Criterion is to make users aware of important changes in content that are not given focus, and to do so in a way that doesn't unnecessarily interrupt their work.
                            The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve status messages.

                            This Success Criterion specifically addresses scenarios where new content is added to the page without changing the user's context. 
                            Changes of context, by their nature, interrupt the user by taking focus. They are already surfaced by assistive technologies, 
                            and so have already met the goal to alert the user to new content.
                            <br><br>
                            Information can be added to pages which does not meet the definition of a status message. For example, the list of results obtained from a search are not considered a status update and 
                            thus are not covered by this Success Criterion. However, brief text messages displayed about the completion or status of the search, such as "Searching...", "18 results returned" or 
                            "No results returned" would be status updates if they do not take focus.
